    "Project Work": "•  Semantic Document Intelligence  ( Link ): Designed an offline semantic analysis pipeline for structured PDF extraction and contextual relevance ranking in the domain of Document AI and Information Retrieval. Implemented heading- based section parsing with semantic embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2), cosine similarity ranking, and TF-IDF keyword extraction for refined summaries. Optimized for CPU-only environments, achieving sub-60s processing of multiple doc- uments while ensuring complete data privacy. •  RAG Insurance Query Processor : Developed a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to answer natural-language insurance queries against uploaded policy documents. Built multilingual NLP and Question Answer- ing capabilities with document ingestion (OCR fallback), FAISS-based vector search, and Gemini LLM for structured intent parsing. Integrated JSON-based decision generation with justification and source clauses. Built React frontend for file uploads, query submission, and results visualization •  Voice Over Generation Bot:  Commentary Bot with API Integration – Developed a Python-based tool to generate voiceover scripts from video frames using OpenAI and Gemini APIs. Applied Computer Vision and Video Processing (OpenCV) with text-to-speech (gTTS), automating speech synthesis and commentary generation for 100+ frames.",
